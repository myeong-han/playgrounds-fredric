GOOD NEWS!
====================

You've successfully installed the docker-mailserver helm chart!

Initial Setup
------------

If you have not yet configured your mail server you'll need to quickly open a command
prompt inside the running container (you have two minutes) and setup a first email account.

    kubectl exec -it --namespace mail deploy/docker-mailserver -- bash

    setup email add user@example.com password

This will create a file:

    cat /tmp/docker-mailserver/postfix-accounts.cf

Next, run the setup command to see additional options:

    setup

For more information please refer to this Chart's README file.

{{ if .Values.proxyProtocol.enabled -}}  

Proxy Ports
------------
You have enabled PROXY protocol support, likely because you are running on a bare metal Kubernetes cluster. This means additional ports have been created that are configured for the PROXY protocol. These ports are in the 10,000 range - thus IMAPs is 10993 (10000 + 993), SUBMISSION is 10587 (10000 + 587), etc.

It is now up to you to configure incoming traffic to use these ports. For more information please refer to this Chart's README file.
